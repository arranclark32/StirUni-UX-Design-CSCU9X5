# StirUni-UX-Design-CSCU9X5
This project involved the design and development of an interactive website aimed at supporting new Computer Science students at Stirling University. I aimed to create an accessible platform that helps students familiarise themselves with their degree structure, key resources, and campus life through a clear and intuitive digital experience.
