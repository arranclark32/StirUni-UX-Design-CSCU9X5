- Navigation supports both desktop and mobile users (hamburger menus, sticky nav bar, breadcrumbs).
- All multimedia has descriptive alt text; semantic HTML and plain English enable easy translation and accessibility.
- High-contrast, non-distracting palette suitable for users with color perception differences and neurodiverse students.
